# Teamviewer Management
Collection of scripts I have used to make the management of Teamviewer easier

## Teamviewer 'Management' Verbiage
There are now 2 ways to manage devices within Teamviewer, and there are different names for these management types. It also seems like Teamviewer interchanges some of ways they refer to both. So I'll update this as I see things change

# Teamviewer Remote
This is the newer way and can be reffered to as 'Device Management', 'Device Groups'

# Teamviewer (Classic)
This is the older way and can be reffered to as 'Computers & Contancts'
